I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at <strong>Paris-Saclay University</strong>, <strong>majoring in Control, Signal and Image Processing</strong>. This year, I enrolled in the ATSI master's program that collaborates with <strong>ENS Paris-Saclay</strong> and <strong>CentralSupélec</strong>. This program is centered on advanced topics such as robot control, image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I obtained my engineering degree from <strong>Arts Et Métiers ParisTech</strong>, one of the leading engineering schools in France, specializing in <strong>robotics and artificial intelligence</strong>. This summer, I did my internship at L'Oréal Innovation and Recherche, where I used a visual servo solution to control a robot to apply makeup to human faces, and an RL solution to improve the robot's performance.

I'm now looking for <strong>a Ph.D. opportunity in Robotics</strong>, I'm interested in improving the agility and dexterity of robots through the integration of optimal control and reinforcement learning. This involves designing algorithms for efficient control and optimization and exploring their theoretical foundations and real-world applications. I'm also interested in robot perception and robot-human interaction, which can make robots more integrated into human society. My goal is to advance the field of robotics and find new solutions to its challenges.
