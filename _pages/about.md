I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at Paris-Saclay University, specializing in Robotics and Computer Vision. This academic year, I enrolled in the ATSI master's program, a collaboration between ENS Paris-Saclay and CentralSupélec. This program is centered on advanced topics such as robot control, image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I got my engineering degree from Arts Et Métiers ParisTech, one of France's leading engineering schools. During my studies there, I specialized in robotics and artificial intelligence.

I am now seeking a Ph.D. opportunity that aligns with my interests in robot control, robot perception, and robot intelligence like reinforcement learning.
