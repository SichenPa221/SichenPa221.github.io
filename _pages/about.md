I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at <strong>CentraleSupélec-Paris-Saclay University</strong>. This year, I enrolled in the [ATSI master's program](https://www.master-atsi.universite-paris-saclay.fr)(Control, Signal and Image Processing), a collaborative effort between <strong>ENS Paris-Saclay</strong>, <strong>IOGS ParisTech</strong>, and <strong>CentraleSupélec</strong>. The curriculum is focused on advanced subjects including robot control, image processing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I obtained my engineering degree from <strong>Arts Et Métiers ParisTech</strong>, one of the leading engineering schools in France, specializing in <strong>robotics and artificial intelligence</strong>. This summer, I did my internship at L'Oréal Innovation and Research, where I used a visual servo solution to control a robot to apply makeup to human faces, and an RL solution to improve the robot's performance. 

I'm now looking for <strong>a Ph.D. opportunity in Robotics</strong>, I'm interested in improving the agility and dexterity of robots through the integration of optimal control and reinforcement learning. This involves designing algorithms for efficient control and optimization and exploring their theoretical foundations and real-world applications. I'm also interested in robot perception and robot-human interaction, which can make robots more integrated into human society. My goal is to advance the field of robotics and find new solutions to its challenges.
