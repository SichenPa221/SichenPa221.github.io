For many systems, especially those described by differential equations, the output at any given time is a result of an accumulated process. This accumulation can be due to several factors:

Past Inputs: In systems with memory (like many real-world systems), the output at a particular time is influenced not just by the current input but by past inputs as well. This is especially evident in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems where the output is the convolution of the input with the system's impulse response.

System Dynamics: The inherent dynamics of a system, described by its differential equations, often involve integrative behavior. For instance, in a simple RC circuit (resistor and capacitor in series), the voltage across the capacitor is the result of the accumulated charge over time, which is an integral of the current flowing into it.

Initial Conditions: The state of the system at the start (initial conditions) also plays a role in the accumulated process. For instance, if a pendulum starts from a raised position, its subsequent motion is influenced by that initial condition.

Continuous Interaction: In many systems, the input continuously interacts with the system's dynamics. The output at any moment is a result of this ongoing interaction, accumulating effects over time.

In essence, many systems can be thought of as "accumulators" where the output at any time is a culmination of past inputs, system dynamics, and initial conditions. This perspective is particularly useful when trying to understand integrative behaviors in systems like filters, accumulators, integrators, and many real-world physical systems.
