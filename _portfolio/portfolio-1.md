title: "Learning Optimal"
excerpt: "**Abstract**: Imitation Learning(IL) algorithms have shown great success in human-robot manipulation skills transferring. However, they assume access to optimal human demonstrations and don't explicitly model the environment dynamics, which limits the optimality of learned manipulation skills and their performance in solving contact-rich tasks. Humans learn professional manipulation skills through imitating experts and improving the learned skills from trials and errors. In this letter, we develop a human-like safe optimal manipulation skills learning framework for solving contact-rich tasks. This framework combines IL methods with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for learning initial manipulation skills by imitating human demonstrations and further optimizing the initial skills with trials and errors. Furthermore, we propose using demonstration space to constrain the learned optimal actions in continuous action space for the safe exploration of RL agents. We also further develop our learning framework to learn optimal variable impedance manipulation skills for avoiding large contact forces and ensuring interaction safety. Simulation and real-world experiments on a 7 DoF redundant robot manipulator for peg insertion tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The MURA (Make Up with Robotic Arm) project focuses on developing advanced models for makeup application, integrating robotic systems, computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. The primary objective is to enable a robotic arm to apply makeup, such as lipstick or eye liner, to a face. The robotic arm is equipped with a gripper enhanced with force sensing capabilities to hold the makeup product and measure the applied force, as well as a depth camera for accurate perception of the person's face.
