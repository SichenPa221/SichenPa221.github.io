The MURA (Make Up with Robotic Arm) project focuses on developing advanced models for makeup application, integrating robotic systems, computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning. The primary objective is to enable a robotic arm to apply makeup, such as lipstick or eye liner, to a face. The robotic arm is equipped with a gripper enhanced with force sensing capabilities to hold the makeup product and measure the applied force, as well as a depth camera for accurate perception of the person's face.
