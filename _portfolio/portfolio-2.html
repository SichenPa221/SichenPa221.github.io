The GREENBOTAI project, which spans from 2021 to 2025, represents a critical initiative aimed at advancing the field of robotics. We're honored to have the backing of Grai Matter Lab, pioneers in AI chip technology. Further enriching our collaborative landscape are renowned institutions, Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech and Fraunhofer IWU.

At the heart of our involvement in the project, we are dedicated to the machine learning domain. Our focal point is the swift training of neural networks that precisely gauge the poses of objects intended for handling. In the ensuing phases, our team will relay commands to robots, equipping them to perform pick-and-place operations. These tasks will be guided by the grasping parameters, meticulously shaped by our machine learning techniques.
