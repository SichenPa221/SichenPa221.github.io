The work being conducted is a vital component of the GREENBOTAI project, which is scheduled to run from 2021 to 2025. This project has received support from Grai Matter Lab, a company specializing in AI chips, and involves collaboration with Arts et MÃ©tiers ParisTech and Fraunhofer IWU. 

Our overarching objective within this project is to develop and implement embedded machine learning solutions for a wide range of robotics applications.

Within the scope of our project, our primary responsibility revolves around the machine learning aspect. Specifically, we are focused on the rapid training of neural networks to accurately estimate the poses of objects that are to be handled. In a subsequent phase, we will transmit commands to the robot, enabling it to carry out pick-and-place tasks in accordance with the grasping parameters determined by the machine learning algorithms.
